Kakano is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme with a smooth gradient background based on your accent color.

## Features
- Uses the accent colour extensively as a base for workspace backgrounds and controls. If you reguarly use multiple vaults, setting a different accent colour for each makes them easy to distinguish visually.
- If the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin is installed, it can be used to set a base color independent of the accent color.
- Light/dark modes.
- On macOS, close buttons appear at the left of tabs and modals, where they belong.
- Minimal design with consistent appearance for controls.

### With Style Settings Plugin
If the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin is installed, Kakano offers the following settings.
- Set a base color for Kakano independent of the accent color in the main settings.
- Position properties before (default) or after the main note content.
