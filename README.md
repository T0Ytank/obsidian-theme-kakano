Kakano is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme with a mooth gradient background based on your accent color.

## Features
- Uses the accent colour extensively as a base for workspace backgrounds and controls. If you reguarly use multiple vaults, setting a different accent colour for each makes them easy to distinguish visually.
- If the Style Settings plugin is installed, it can be used to set a base color independent of the accent color.
- On macOS, close buttons appear at the left of tabs and modals.
- Minimal design with consistent appearance for controls.
