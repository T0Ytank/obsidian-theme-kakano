Kakano is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme with a smooth gradient background based on your accent color.

## Features
- Uses the accent colour extensively as a base for workspace backgrounds and controls. If you reguarly use multiple vaults, setting a different accent colour for each makes them easy to tell apart at a glance.
- Creates a visual distinction between Obsidian controls (colored background) and your content (white background in light mode, black background in dark mode).
- If the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin is installed, it can be used to set a base color independent of the accent color.
- Light/dark modes.
- On macOS, close buttons appear at the left of tabs and modals, where they belong.
- Minimal design with consistent appearance for controls.
- Uses system fonts by default to be consistent with other apps. User settings are of course respected if you want something different.

### Settings
If the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin is installed, Kakano offers the following settings.
- **Base color**
  Sets a base color that will be used by Kakano independently of the accent color. This allows you to use one color for Kakano, and a separate color for accents in your notes.
- **Properties position**
  In Live Preview mode, properties can be positioned before (default) or after the main note content. If you rarely use properties, you may prefer to make them less prominent.
  _This setting only works for Live Preview mode. Reading mode doesn't provide suitable HTML structure to support it, and Source Mode makes properties editable within the main content area.
